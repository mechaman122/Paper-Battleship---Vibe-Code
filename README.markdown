# 2D Paper Battleship Game

A 2D Battleship game built with Godot, featuring matchmaking against AI or players, ship placement, and turn-based attacks. Future updates will include passives and special abilities.

## Disclaimer
This is a personal project to demonstrate how AI can handle coding with strict human guidance (a.k.a me), hence the name vibe-coding. 90% of the code is AI-generated, with logical setup proposed and improvised by me.

## Requirements
- Matchmaking system for AI or player opponents.
- Grid-based field for ship placement (e.g., 10x10).
- Turn-based combat to hit enemy ships.
- Win condition: destroy all enemy ships.
- Future support for passives and special abilities.
- Simple, clean 2D visuals inspired by paper aesthetics.

## Tech Stack
- **Game Engine**: Godot (open-source, lightweight, supports 2D).
- **Programming Language**: GDScript (Godot’s scripting language, Python-like).
- **Networking**: Godot’s built-in networking for multiplayer.
- **UI/Graphics**: Godot’s 2D nodes and sprite system.
- **Version Control**: Git (with GitHub for hosting).

## Milestones
1. **Core Game Mechanics**: Implement grid system, ship placement, and turn-based attacks vs. AI.
2. **AI Opponent**: Develop basic AI for ship placement and attack strategies.
3. **Multiplayer Matchmaking**: Add online matchmaking for player vs. player mode.
4. **Polish and Visuals**: Create paper-style 2D assets and refine UI/UX.
5. **Passives and Abilities**: Introduce special abilities and passive effects for ships.
